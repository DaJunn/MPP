# 6.Build Machine Learning Models
Get hands-on experience building and deriving insights from machine learning models using Python and Azure Notebooks.

# 7.Build Deep Learning Models
Deep learning is a key enabler of AI powered technologies being developed across the globe. In this deep learning course, you will learn an intuitive approach to building complex models that help machines solve real-world problems with human-like intelligence. The intuitive approaches will be translated into working code with practical problems and hands-on experience. You will learn how to build and derive insights from these models using Python Jupyter notebooks running on your local Windows or Linux machine, or on a virtual machine running on Azure. You will learn how to use the Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit to harness the intelligence within massive datasets through deep learning with uncompromised scaling, speed, and accuracy.

# 8.Build Reinforcement Learning Models
Reinforcement Learning (RL) is an area of machine learning, where an agent learns by interacting with its environment to achieve a goal.In this course, you will be introduced to the world of reinforcement learning. You will learn how to frame reinforcement learning problems and start tackling classic examples like news recommendation, learning to navigate in a grid-world, and balancing a cart-pole. You will explore the basic algorithms from multi-armed bandits, dynamic programming, TD (temporal difference) learning, and progress towards larger state space using function approximation, in particular using deep learning. You will also learn about algorithms that focus on searching the best policy with policy gradient and actor critic methods. Along the way, you will get introduced to Project Malmo, a platform for Artificial Intelligence experimentation and research built on top of the Minecraft game.
